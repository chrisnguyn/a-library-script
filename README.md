# Bookee
Got really tired of logging into the York University library website to book the same study room every day. Naturally, I made a script to do it for me - Python + Selenium for life.

## Setup
1. Install all modules needed - time and selenium (pip3 install time, pip3 install selenium)
2. Create and populate environment variables (username.txt, password.txt, populate with your York University credentials)
3. python3 main.py - enjoy!
