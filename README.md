# A Library Script
Got really tired of logging into the York University library website to book the same study room every day. Naturally, I made a script to do it for me with Python + Selenium

## Setup
1. Install all modules needed - time and selenium (`pip3 install time`, `pip3 install selenium`) *(actually I'm pretty sure time is part of Python's standard library so you don't need to install it - note from future Chris)*
2. Create and populate environment variables (username.txt, password.txt, populate with your York University credentials)
3. python3 main.py - have fun!
